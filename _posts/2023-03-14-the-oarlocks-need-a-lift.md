Today I was joined by Jeremy from down the street. (Thanks Jeremy!) Here's Jeremy looking fly.

Our point was to basically just kick the tires and experience a few things to inspire the next round of changes.

1 - First up, even without sliding seats, we need a brace to put our feet against. Otherwise we just can't row with any amount of power. Our top speed was only about 1.5 knots. Let's see how much we can improve on that with something to push against.

2 - The oarlocks could use a block on top to lift the pivot point a few inches up. That will just provide a bit of room to fit big strong thighs under the oars.

3 - A camera swinging from a hook takes terrible video.
