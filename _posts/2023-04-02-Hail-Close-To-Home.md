Today's practice run involved a bit of hail for good measure. "Hail like this feels fine when you're close to home."

Today we worked out the forestay issue, and experienced a bit more what appears will be a common mode... bigger waves and insufficient winds to push through them.

Average speed about 1.3 knots over 3.5 hours.
