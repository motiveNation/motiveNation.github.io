Today we successfully rowed the Hobie Cat for the first time. It was a short hop from the mooring to some dock space donated to the cause.

It was decidely not optimal, but it was very inexpensive. The boat owner understandably has asked that we not make any permanent modifications to the boat, so rather than getting to weld on a rowing rigger, we will be doing things like building clamps that can hang on to the Hobie's frame for dear life.

I have to say I was surprised at how effective our wooden clamp turned out.
