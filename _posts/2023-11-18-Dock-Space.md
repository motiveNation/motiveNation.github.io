Today was the first day of the winter season! What I found last year was that having access to dock space for the boat(s) makes all the difference. So I'm lucky to have found a spot on a friend's dock for the winter. I'll be able to bike down and go rowing (winging? kiting?!!) whenever I can get away from work.

I even have some as yet unallocated vacation time coming to me, so I'm in a good position to actually knock some milestones over!

Stay tuned!
