The past couple months thing have been ramping up. The Fireball was resurrected from the yard, a new centerboard was made, some jury rigged riggers for some proper oars were made... so as of today we have our basic, standard, multimodal, no engine toy boat.

Also, First Light now has its own <a href="https://youtube.com/@FirstLightSailing-bk4nl?si=4ln5_Lgq1lO6ATf8">YouTube Channel</a>. That'll likely be the more interesting place to get updates for now.

There you'll see today's video of the first moments that First Light was pushed around by canvas. It'll be fun to figure out when to switch modes, beyond just the obvious "too tired to row? try sailing" strategy.
