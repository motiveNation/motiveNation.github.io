Great News! I have been accepted into Race to Alaska for the 2024 edition!

This is a huge milestone toward our aims. Being in this year's race is going to provide me with the opportunity to get some serious long distance experience and exposure.

It'll be about perspective.

I'm going to leverage that perspective when it comes to future projects. What kind of stability will I be able to achieve? What designs will be practical?

Also, this will give me an opportunity to share my projects with like minded folks in person.

Stay tuned for further updates and some consolidation of how I communicate with folks.

Onward!
